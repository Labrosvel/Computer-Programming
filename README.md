# Movie recommender
In this project we write a python class to store and handle movie data. With these Movie objects, we created a simple movie recommendation system
which will recommend a movie from the dataset based on the similarity to a movie that you provide it

# Titanic data analysis
In this project we conduct data analysis in the famous titanic dataset. Specifically:
- Conducting EDA and subsetting
- Check the distribution of fares according to differenct classes (1st vs 2nd vs 3rd class)
- Removing the records that seem like genuine outliers (eg. fares higher than Â£300)
- Obtain frequencies for categorical values (eg. 'Survived', 'Pclass' etc.)
- Summarise the findings about the columns and the records which have missing values
- Finding possible correlation between the Age of the passengers and the class they are travelling
